# Quojo
A Quantum Computing Simulation written in Mojo. This really only serves as one of my passion projects, but I would like it to expand into a larger platform for Quantum Development.

## Goals
This project aims to implement classical strong simulation for quantum circuits with Parametric Rewriting in ZX-Calculus ([Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.06777)) using the Mojo and Max Engine APIs to accelerate computation.

I'm deferring development to Rust at the moment while we wait for Mojo to have the features I'd like it to have :((
