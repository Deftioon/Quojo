# Quojo
A Quantum Computing Simulation written in Mojo. This really only serves as one of my passion projects, but I would like it to expand into a larger platform for Quantum Development.

## Goals
This project aims to implement classical strong simulation for quantum circuits with Parametric Rewriting in ZX-Calculus ([Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.06777)) using the Mojo and Max Engine APIs to accelerate computation.
